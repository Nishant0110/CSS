                            <p>Bootstrap Containers are very essential and basic building blocks of bootstrap
                                that wrap
                                a page's content.</p>
                            <p>It's responsible for setting and aligning content within it according to viewport

                                given device.</p>
                            <p>containers are established the width for the layout to give the content.</p>
                            <p>A Container wraps a page's content, providing structure and alignment within a
