                            <p>&#8680;React can be used to develop single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications

                            <p>&#8680;The coolest thing about React is it’s based on components, you break down your

                                the application.</p>
                            <p>&#8680; These components typically handle the display and layout of the header section

                                    pages or views.</p>
                                <p>&#8680;It is responsible for rendering the top section of the application, providing

                                    entire application.</p>
                                <p>&#8680;The "Header" component might receive data or configuration through props,
                                    allowing it to be customized based on the requirements of different sections of the
