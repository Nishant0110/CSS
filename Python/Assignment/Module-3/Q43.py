# Why Do You Use the Zip () Method in Python?
```
--> Python zip() method in Python combines multiple iterables into a single iterator of tuples, with each tuple containing elements from each iterable at corresponding positions
--> zip() can accept any type of iterable, such as files, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and so on.
--> The primary purpose of zip() is to facilitate parallel iteration over multiple sequences. It pairs corresponding elements from each iterable, creating a new iterable of tuples.
