# How to Define a Class in Python? What Is Self? Give An Example Of A Python Class
'''
>   To define a class in Python, you use the class keyword followed by the class name and a colon.
    The class body starts at the next indentation level.
>   In Python, self represents the instance of the class.
    It allows you to access the attributes and methods of the class within its own scope.
    When you create an object (instance) from a class, the object is automatically passed as the first argument to any method using the self parameter.
    This enables you to modify the objectâ€™s properties and execute tasks unique to that particular instance.
