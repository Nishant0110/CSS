# What happens when „1‟== 1 is executed?
'''
>   Data Types: The expression involves comparing a string ("1") with an integer (1). In Python, these are different data types.
    The string "1" is not the same as the integer 1.

>   If the types of the values being compared are different, Python will determine that they are not equal without attempting to convert one type to another.
>   Therefore, since a string ("1") is not the same as an integer (1), the result of the comparison is False.
