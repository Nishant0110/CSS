# How Do You Handle Exceptions With Try/Except/Finally In Python? Explain with coding snippets.
'''
>   try block: Code that might throw an exception is placed here.
>   except block: Code that handles exceptions is placed here.
>   finally block: Code that should run no matter what (e.g., cleanup code) is placed here.

Code:

try:
    # Code that may raise an exception
    result = 10 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError as e:
    # Handle the exception
    print(f"Caught an exception: {e}")
finally:
    # Code that will run no matter what
    print("This will always execute")

Output:

Caught an exception: division by zero
This will always execute
