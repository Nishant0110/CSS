# What are oops concepts? Is multiple inheritance supported in python.
'''
1. class:- It is a group of different type of data and function.

2. object:- It is an instance of class.
    
3. inheritance:- The object of one class can aquire the properties of object of another class is called inheritance.
                 Creating a new class from an existing class is called inheritance.
    1. Single
    2. Multilevel
    3. Multiple :-Python supports multiple inheritance, meaning a class can inherit from more than one parent class. This feature allows a subclass to inherit properties and behavior from multiple parent classes. 
    4. Hierarchical
    5. Hybrid
    
4. polymorphisam:- One name multiple form its called polymorphism.

    > 1. Compile Time Polymorphism - (Method Overloading) - When there is a more than one method in a single class having the same name but with different
    number of arguments then it is called method overloading.

    > 2. Run Time Polymorphism - (Method Overriding) - When there is a same method prototype in your both base class & derived class & if you call
    that method using the object of derived class, then only derived class method will be called. So you can say that method of derived class overrides
    method of base class.
    
5. abstraction :- The process of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object.

6. encapsulation :- To bind a data and code into a single unit is called.
