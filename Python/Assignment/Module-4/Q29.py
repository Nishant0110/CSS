# What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person?
'''
In Python, the appropriate relationship between Student and Person is typically an inheritance relationship.
This means that Student would be a subclass of Person.
Inheritance is used to express an "is-a" relationship, where a Student "is a" Person.
