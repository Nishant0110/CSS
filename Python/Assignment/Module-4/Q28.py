# What relationship is appropriate for Course and Faculty?

'''
The appropriate relationship between Course and Faculty in Python is typically an association relationship.
This means that a Course is associated with one or more Faculty members, but neither class is a subclass of the other.
This association is often implemented using attributes that reference instances of the other class.
